Device tree binding for NVIDIA Tegra XUSB host mode controller (XHCI)
============================

The Tegra xHCI controller complies to xHCI specifications which supports
both USB 2.0 HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed and USB 3.0 SuperSpeed protocols.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - compatible: For Tegra186, must contain "nvidia,tegra186-xhci".
 - mboxes: Must contain an entry for the XUSB mailbox channel.
   See ../mailbox/mailbox.txt for details.
 - mbox-names: Must include the following entries:
   - xusb

Required properties for Tegra186:
---------------------------------
 - avddio_usb-supply: 3.3V supply to USB 2.0 pads.
 - avdd_pll_utmip-supply: 1.8V supply to UTMI PLL.
 - hvdd_usb-supply: 1.8V supply to PEX USB 3.0 pads.

 - phys: Must contain an entry for each entry in phy-names.
   See ../phy/phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - phy-names: Should include an entry for each PHY used by the controller.
   Names must be of the form "<type>-<number>" where <type> is one of "utmi",
   "hsic", or "usb3" and <number> is a 0-based index.
   On Tegra186, there may be up to:
   - 3 USB3 PHYs, SuperSpeed (SSTX+/SSTX-/SSRX+/SSRX-) data lines
   - 3 UTMI PHYs, USB 2.0 (D+/D-) data lines
   - 1 HSIC PHYs, HSIC (DATA/STROBE) data lines

Optional properties:
--------------------
 - nvidia,pmc-usb-wakes-disabled: set if platform doesn't support/require waking system from
   suspend with USB events.
 - extcon-cables: OTG support. Must contains an excon-cable entry which detects
   USB ID pin. See ../extcon/extcon-gpio-states.txt for details.
   When the extcon cable state is 1, OTG port will transition to host mode.
 - extcon-cable-names: Must be "id".

Example:
--------
	xhci@3530000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-xhci";
		mboxes = <&xusb_mbox>;
		mbox-names = "xusb";
		phys = <&padctl TEGRA_PADCTL_PHY_UTMI_P(0)>, /* USB 2.0 micro-AB, J20 */
			<&padctl TEGRA_PADCTL_PHY_UTMI_P(1)>, /* USB 3.0 STD-A, J19 */
			<&padctl TEGRA_PADCTL_PHY_USB3_P(1)>; /* USB 3.0 STD-A, J19 */
		phy-names = "utmi-0", "utmi-1", "usb3-1";

		avddio_usb-supply = <&spmic_sd3_3v3>;
		avdd_pll_utmip-supply = <&spmic_sd2_1v8>;
		hvdd_usb-supply =  <&spmic_sd2_1v8>;

		extcon-cables = <&vbus_id_extcon 1>;
		extcon-cable-names = "id";
		#extcon-cells = <1>;
	};
